# LandIt: Predicting Time to Land a Data Science Job

## 📄 Project Overview
LandIt is a synthetic data science project designed to predict how many months it will take for an entry-level candidate to land their first data science job. This project uses regression modeling techniques based on realistic factors like degree field, internship experience, and other career variables.
